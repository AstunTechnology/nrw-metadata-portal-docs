"Metadata is essentially information about data.  It describes, among "
"other things,  who collected it, why it was collected, the methods used "
"to collect it and how it can be used.  Metadata provides all the "
"information a data user needs to assess whether the data resource is fit "
"for use. Metadata allows users to:"

"Metadata is important to both the dataset provider and other potential "
"users. High quality metadata allows dataset owners to keep an inventory "
"of datasets they have created, with the ability to locate the data and "
"recall the circumstances and context under which it was created and "
"analysed. When publicly available, metadata enables other interested "
"parties the ability to discover, understand and use the data to its "
"fullest potential."

msgid ""
"A metadata standard is a specification which establishes a common "
"understanding of the meaning (or semantics) of data, to ensure correct "
"and proper use and interpretation by its owners and users. Many standards"
" begin as schemas, which group metadata elements into sets designed for a"
" specific purpose (e.g. for geospatial data) to enable the best possible "
"description of a data resource in that context. For every element the "
"name and semantics are specified, along with any rules on how content "
"must be formulated and represented, and where element values are to be "
"identified from controlled lists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../UserDoc_Chap1_Intro.rst:26
msgid ""
"The development of such schemas tends to be controlled through community "
"consensus combined with a formal processes for submission, approval and "
"publishing of new elements. Schemas that are developed and maintained by "
"standards organisations (e.g. ISO) or organisations that have taken on "
"such responsibility (e.g. Dublin Core Metadata Initiative) are called "
"metadata standards."

"The UK Geospatial Metadata Interoperability Initiative (`GEMINI "

"Information (AGI), the e-Government Unit (eGU) and the UK Data Archive. "
"An application profile of ISO 19115, UK GEMINI is conformant with the "

msgid ""
"Metadata adds significant value to any organisation’s data holdings, and "
"failure to create it can lead to hidden costs generated at a later date. "
"Undocumented data soon loses its value as staff change and institutional "
"knowledge is lost. Subsequent staff with little understanding of the "
"contents and use of the data and may lose confidence in results generated"
" by it."

"Beyond the individual organisation, data resources are a major national "
"asset. Information of what data resources exist within different "
"organisations, particularly within the public sector, is required to "
"improve efficiencies and reduce data duplication. Metadata standards "

"from a variety of sources can be integrated into other technical systems "
"or machine read by compatible ones. Adoption of metadata standards "
"greatly increases the potential for data discoverability."

"`UK GEMINI <https://www.agi.org.uk/agi-groups/standards-committee/uk-"
"gemini>`__ is the designated standard for geographic metadata in the "
"United Kingdom. It ensures consistency with respect to metadata across "
"the UK through content guidance and the use of UK specific terms and code"
" lists. UK Gemini also  simplifies the INSPIRE Technical Guidance making "
"it easier for organisations to achieve compliance."

"While ensured compliance to regulations is important, the key benefit is "
"the interoperability the standard allows across a range of platforms. "
"Metadata in the Gemini format can be shared and consumed easily by a "
"number of platforms and third party applications. Gemini is a requirement"
" for the data.gov.uk portal and, with version 2.3, can now be consumed by"
" the ESRI ArcGIS platform without the need of additional plugins."
